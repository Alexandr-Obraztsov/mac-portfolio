				I am a frontend developer with more than 1 year
				<br />
				of experience in creating SPA applications
				<br />
				using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Next.js, HTML, and CSS.
				<br />
				<br />
				In my free time, I study new technologies
				<br />
				and deepen my knowledge in the ones I have
				<br />
				already mastered. I also enjoy solving algorithmic problems.
				<br />
				<br />
				Since childhood, I&apos;ve loved creating something,
				<br />
				and after getting to know a computer, I quickly
				<br />
				found entertainment for myself â€” creating modifications for games.
				<br />
				<br />
				Later, I started doing game development, backend development,
				micro-board programming,
				<br />
				and finally, frontend development. Since then, frontend has become my
				main area of interest
				<br />
				and professional activity.
