				I am a frontend developer with more than 1 year of experience in
				creating SPA applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux,
				Next.js, HTML, and CSS.
				<br />
				<br />
				In my free time, I study new technologies and deepen my knowledge in the
				ones I have already mastered. I also enjoy solving algorithmic problems.
				<br />
				<br />
				Since childhood, I&apos;ve loved creating something, and after getting
				to know a computer, I quickly found entertainment for myself â€” creating
				modifications for games.
				<br />
				<br />
				Later, I started doing game development, backend development,
				micro-board programming, and finally, frontend development. Since then,
				frontend has become my main area of interest and professional activity.
